npm run dev
# or

st way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Running with Docker

Before dockerizing the application and running the restaurantapp with the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml, you will need to create your own .env file with credentials for strapi and mongodb. An example of what that file could look like is in env.txt file.
